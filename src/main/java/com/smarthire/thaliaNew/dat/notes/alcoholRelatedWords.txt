English version of thesaurus of relating to or associ
======================================================================================
“Neat” means simply your alcohol of choice all by itself at room temperature – no mix or ice.

“On the rocks” is your alcohol of choice over ice.

“A cocktail” is a mixed drink that contains both alcohol and non-alcoholic mixers.

“Straight up” is a method of serving either liquor or a cocktail, without ice. However, drinks served straight up are typically chilled first with ice and then strained while being poured into a glass.

“A mist” is when straight alcohol is poured over crushed ice and served.

“A chaser” is a drink that is typically a little more palatable than a shot of straight liquor and is used to help wash down the shot. It is usually a beer or a non-alcoholic drink.

“Shooters” are strong little drinks served in shot glasses. Typically made up of a variety of alcohols, they can include non-alcoholic mixers too.

“Shots” are pure alcohol served in shot glasses. A shot can be a serving of just one type of alcohol or it can be a mixture of more than one kind. Shots are meant to be gulped down in one, well, shot.

“A sour” is usually a whiskey drink, but can be made with other types of liquor also. In addition to the alcohol of choice, a sour also contains sugar and lime juice or lemon juice to give it bitterness.

“A tot” is simply a short shot. It can be found in a weak drink or a double that is not quite doubled.

“Well drinks” are the less-expensive versions of spirits like rum, vodka, and whiskey that are kept in the well or speed rail of a bar and used to mix drinks unless a specific brand is ordered.

“A toddy” is a drink that has been mixed with a base of hot water. Often a toddy is suggested as a remedy for many things.

“A mixer” is any non-alcoholic beverage that is used to mix with alcohol in order to create a cocktail.

“Perfect” is the term used for a drink that is made with both dry and sweet vermouth in equal amounts.

Give Your Drink Order Something Special

There are so many ways to dress up a drink. In fact many cocktails have their own version of how a drink should be presented, with a fruit wedge, an olive, a cherry, an umbrella, or some other addition. However, you can also make your own adjustments to your favorite drink with simply a word or two if you know the right words to use.

“Twist” – A twist is a little citrus peel that has been thinly sliced and twisted into a cocktail. The zest of the fruit releases oils into the drink to give it a brisk, light flavor.

“Dirty” – A dirty drink, fun as it sounds, is typically just a term reserved for martinis and means that olive juice has been used in making the martini.

“Virgin” – A virgin drink is one without alcohol. That doesn’t mean that every non-alcoholic beverage is virgin. We don’t talk about virgin milk or virgin juice. However, cocktails that are made without spirits are always referred to as virgin drinks.

“Mocktail” – Mocktail is another term for a virgin drink.

Knowing What You Are Drinking

While knowing what you are ordering will keep you from sounding like a dummy, knowing what you are drinking will keep you out of trouble. Too often people find it embarrassing to let on that they don’t understand what is being offered. They simply say yes and indulge in the drink offered. Drinking blind like that can lead to trouble, so take the time to learn these important words.

“Proof “ is more than what’s in the pudding. Proof is about the amount of alcohol by volume. If you order 100 proof, you typically get 50% alcohol. Ordering a 151 proof alcohol is a lot more alcohol per shot, so beware. Also, if you are across the pond, know that the measuring system is different in the United Kingdom. Their 100-proof liquor is actually more than 114 proof in the U.S.

“Infusions” are popular variations on many spirits, which are made simply by letting fresh foods like vegetables, fruit, or herbs sit in the spirit of choice until that spirit takes on the flavor of the food. It is most often done with vodka, rum, tequila, and gin.

“Whiskey” is a spirit typically made from fermented corn, wheat, rye, barley, and oats. It is aged for two years in oak barrels and is between 80 and 160 proof.

“Bourbon” is a variation of whiskey that many people often confuse with whiskey.

“Gin” is another fermented grain liquor that has added herbs and juniper berries for flavoring.

“Vodka” is the most tasteless and clear of liquors, typically made from potato or grain. Because of its lack of flavor and scent, it is a good choice for infusions.

“Liqueur or cordial” is a sweet spirit that is usually made from brandy, rum, or whiskey, and has different ingredients added such as seeds, nuts, spices, flowers, fruits, herbs, etc.

Most Popular Types of Alcoholic Beverage
The most popular types of alcoholic beverage include:

* Beer is believed to be alcoholic beverage that humans have been consuming the longest – possibly as far back as 9,600 BC. It is created by fermenting any of a variety of starches including; malted barley, rice, wheat, or maize.
* Cider is made from fermented apple juice – it is sometimes referred to as apple wine.
* Wine can be created from fermented grapes or other fruits. Humans have been drinking wine for at least 8,000 years – wine cultivation occurred in ancient Egypt.
* Spirits refer to those alcoholic drinks that have been distilled to make them stronger.

Types of Beer
The word beer can be used to refer to a number of different alcoholic beverages including:

* Larger beers are fermented and conditioned at low temperatures to give them their milder taste – they are usually also a light color.
* Ales are made from malted barley and involve warm fermentation with brewer’s yeast. Stout drinks such as Guinness are also a type of ale.
* Wheat beers are made with wheat as well as barley – this is what gives them their distinctive taste. This type of beer is particularly popular in Europe.
* Fruit beers are often made by adding flavor extracts to beer rather than fermenting fruit.

Types of Wine
Some people devote a great deal of their life to understanding all about the different wines, but it is possible to divide them into a number of types including:

* Red wine is made from red or black grapes. The taste of red wine is often described as more complex than that of white wine.
* Rose wine is made from red grapes but these undergo a special process to create the rose look.
* White wine is produced using white grapes. This type of wine has a lighter taste than the red or rose wine.
* Champagne (sparkling wine) gets is bubbles from the fermentation process due to carbon dioxide in the bottles.
* Fortified wines (including sherry and port) have a distilled beverage added to them to make the stronger. The reason why fortified wines originally became popular was that they were easier to transport around the world by ship.

Types of Spirits
Spirits refer to a large variety of alcoholic beverages including:

* Vodka is usually made from the distillation of grains or potatoes.
* Whiskey/whisky is made from fermented grain mash.
* Rum comes from sugarcane juice.
* Tequila is created from the blue agave plant.
* Gin is made from juniper berries.
* Absinthe is made from a number of different flowers.
* The popular Greek drink Ouzo is made from anise – this is a type of plant.
* Liqueurs cover a wide range of drinks that involve the addition of herbs, nuts, fruits, spices, cream, or flowers. It is also possible to get other spirits that have been turned into liqueurs – for example vodka liqueur.

Strength of Alcoholic Drinks
The most common way to determine the strength of an alcoholic drink is alcohol by volume (ABV). This measurement is the percentage of alcohol per volume. The strengths of the most common alcoholic drinks are:

* Beer can be anywhere from 2% up to 12% ABV. Low alcohol beers have about 1.2% alcohol but some have even lower than this.
* Cider tends to be anywhere from 2% to 8.5% ABV.
* Wines tend to be from 9% to 16% ABV
* Spirits can be anywhere from 20% to 80% ABV.
