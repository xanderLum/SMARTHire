I don't get drunk, I just get less classy and more fun.
I only smoke when I'm drunk.

Everyone is all like... "I love my boyfriend, I love my husband" And I'm over here like "I love alcohol".
You know what kind of decisions are made while drunk? the best kinds! 
to me 'drink responsibility' means don't spill it.
